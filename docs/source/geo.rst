Python API Reference
====================

**Disclamer**: The documentation in the code was initially written by people, but was then passed through an AI large
language model (specifically ChatGPT-4o) to fill in gaps and correct minor mistakes. The results were also validated by
a person, but it is possible that an AI "hallucination" has occurred that was not caught and resulted in an incorrect
documentation. Please `report an issue <https://github.com/gicait/geoserver-rest/issues>`_ you find one.
